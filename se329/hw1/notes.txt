organizations are consistently missing deadlines and over spending, and when projects succeed its usually due to the developers on that team being
really good at thier job. making future success dependant on those developers.

the basic idea is to change from being unorganized to organized in the project management so that estimations on time and expense are more accurate.
work is done according to set plans and the process is clearly defined and enforced to all staff.

In order to have a more organized and accurate understanding of the organizations development the infrastructure has to be there for a team to be able to
communicate and be organized.

The CMM is not a quick fix for saving a failing project but rather a map for how to steadily improve an organizations processes step by step
so that a more mature approach can be reached in future projects.

level one is chaotic

level two has more experience and planning a project is based on experience with a similar project in the past. making outcomes more
relyable and repeatable

level three has a clearly defined organization wide process for projects which can be tweeked to fit a specific project.
meaning there is a readiness(start) criteria, defined inputs, verification mechinisms (peer review), completion criteria,
and standards for how to work

level four means that there are tools inplace to measure the projects. these measurements are stored in a database and
use to run analysis on the process in order to find ways to further improve it. projects are now expected to fall within
a range of acceptable process preformance. the recorded measurment of this variation allows for statistical analysis
to determain random variation from meaningful divergance. outcomes become very predictable.

level five takes the data from level four and focuses on using this to continually run cost benifit analysis on the process and
propose adjustments to optimise the organizations outcomes.
