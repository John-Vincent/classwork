*DOCUMENTATION*
all functions in the util and network files are documented in the respective header file to keep the implementation files short.
server and client files don't have headers so functions are defined by there function definitions to keep documentation at the top and implemenation compact

*COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS*
you can compile both programs with "make"
or you can compile one at a time with "make server" or "make client"
compiled files will be in the bin folder after compilation.
to run the programs use the commands "bin/server" and "bin/client <arguments>"
