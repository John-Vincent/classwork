  \begin{subquestion}[3.9]
    The current process counter and stack state of the current process must be saved and then the new program counter and stack must be loaded
    for the kernel to make a context switch.
  \end{subquestion}

  \begin{subquestion}[3.12]
    by the end of the loop where will be 16 processes created.
  \end{subquestion}

  \begin{subquestion}[3.15]
    when you have one child and one parent process that need to communicate just for the duration of their execution a normal pipe will work perfectly
    and will automatically be removed upon termination.\\
    When you need a common pipe that will be used by lots of different processes that may not share common ancestors and you want the pipe to exist permanently
    so it can be uses every time the program runs then a named pipe will need to be used.
  \end{subquestion}

  \begin{subquestion}[3.17]
    the child will print 0, -1, -4, -9, -16 and the parent will then print 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 since they both of there own copy of the array nums and they are not using shared memory.
  \end{subquestion}

  \begin{subquestion}[3.18]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item[$\alph$]  Sychronous is easy to program because the order of events in guarenteed, by asychronous is faster because you can have independant operations running at the
      same time, the programmer just has to spend time working on making sure events are happening in the right order.
      \item[$\alph$]
      \item[$\alph$]  Custom item label for entry three
    \end{itemize}
  \end{subquestion}
