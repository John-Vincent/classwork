# Almost all of my college homework

I learned about git in sophmore year of college and started using it
to version control all of my course work. At the time the reason I
did this was because I maintained a private server that I stored
all my repositories on. I regularly used two different computers
and used the private git server to transfer work between them.

Since I still have the repo I thought I would make it public
since its kind of a fun window into the past on the progress
I made as a developer through school.
