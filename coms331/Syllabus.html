<p>
The contents of this course are fundamental to computer science.
The course is typically considered challenging, but also highly rewarding.
For the homework exercisess, you must think both logically and creatively.
The best way to do well in this course is to attack each exercise set as
soon as it is handed out. After you consider various approaches to an exercise
for a while, you might want to put it down and come back to it a day or two later.
The right solution might just jump at you.
Above all, realize that the best way to fail this course is to start working on
your homeworks the night before they are due!
</p>

<p>
After briefly reviewing basic background and introductory notions,
the rest of the course can be divided into three main portions,
each of them requiring approximately one month:
regular languages, context-free languages, and Turing machines.
</p>

<hr size="2"><h3>Attendance and basic etiquette</h3>
<p>
You are required to attend, follow, and actively participate
in all lectures and discussions.
Lectures, discussions, and exams start at the stated time.
Avoid being late coming to class, as this is very disruptive
to the instructor and to your fellow students.
</p>

<p>
You are requested to refrain from using electronic devices
(laptops, cell phones, music players, etc.) during lectures
and exams.
If, <b>for some compelling reason</b>, you need to be on call,
be sure to put your cell phone in silent mode,
and excuse yourself from the class if you need to take a call.
</p>

<p>
Analogously, when you come see me or a TA,
please <b>turn your cell phone off</b>,
and be sure to <b>bring paper and pen</b> to take notes.
</p>

<p>
The best way to reach a TA is to go to recitations or to their office hours.
The second best way is to send them an email.
<br>

The best way to reach me is to come during office hours
(I will be there, barring emergencies).
The second best way is to send me an email
(I check it quite frequently).
The third best way is to try to see if I am available in my office
(I am almost always on campus during the work week, but I am often in meetings).


</p><hr size="2"><h3>Homeworks</h3>
<p>
Weekly homework sets will be assigned (usually on Fridays) and will
be due every Friday night at 11:59pm.
(this includes the last Friday of classes, during Dead Week).
Overall, they account for 40% of your grade.
Both posting of the assignments and turn-in will be through Canvas.
</p>
<p>
One of the goals of this course is to learn how
to write high-quality technical prose. To improve the terseness and readability
of your homeworks, I am requiring you to typeset your homeworks in LaTeX,
which is freely available. I provide examples of LaTeX files for you
to learn how to format particular equations. Pictures, diagrams, and graphs
can be drawn using <tt>tgif</tt> or any other drawing tool that can generate
"eps" or "pdf" files, which can then be included into LaTeX.
You can also create beautiful pictures directly in LaTeX using the TikZ package,
but it does have a learning curve and it is not a WYSIWYG editor,
so this approach requires more effort.
</p>
<p>
Students in the class are allowed to discuss the homework problems
among themselves and with me and the TAs, <b>but not with anybody else</b>.
An <b>empty hand policy</b> must
be observed when you meet with other classmates: you are free
to discuss any aspect of the homework, but you must leave the meeting without
any record (on paper, magnetic tape, digital storage, or other means) of these discussions.
This is because the actual writing of the detailed homework answers must be
an individual activity, so that each student can receive an individual
grade for each homework.
</p>
<p>
<b>Unless stated otherwise, sharing of information
in permanent format (such as accessing someone else's files, hardcopy outputs,
or handwritten notes), will be considered cheating.
If you have even the slightest doubt about whether a certain activity is
admissible, <i>ask me before you do it!</i></b>
</p>
<p>
<b>You are of course allowed, actually encouraged,
to consult other reference material in addition to your textbook and class
notes. However, if you used this reference to derive the answer to an exercise,
you should give it proper credit in your write-up. In no case you should
copy verbatim from a reference without proper attribution, as this is
plagiarism.</b>
</p>
<p><b>It is a bad idea to search for homework solutions on the web:
you might find the answer, but you will have not learned
how to come up with the answer by yourself.</b>
</p><p>
<b>I do not accept late homeworks except for
justifiable reasons, such as an illness with a doctor's written note.</b>
</p>

<hr size="2"><h3>Homework grading method</h3>
<p>
Each homework consists of one or more exercises.
Each exercises carries
a weight (usually 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100 points) and students are required to solve all exercises.
The grade on each exercise is a number between 0 and its weight.
The overall grade for the homeworks as a whole, on a scale
of 0 to 1, is determined by summing the grades of all the exercises and dividing
the result by the sum of all the weights.
Occasionally there may be extra-credit exercises, which you might
attempt in order to boost your grade
(their grade is added to the sum of the grades but their weight is not added to the sum of weights).
</p>
<p>
While I may choose to give you partial credit on an exercise,
almost always an answer is either "right" (perhaps
with minor notational errors or problems that can be easily fixed) or "wrong"
(completely incorrect because of some fundamental flaw in your reasoning).
Thus, the grade you receive on each individual exercise is usually either
close to the maximum or close to zero. However, there are multiple exercises in
a homework set, so the overall grades can, and usually do, span a wide range.
</p>

<hr size="2"><h3>In class examinations</h3>
<p>
I believe that exams should be administered to test
your understanding of the material, not your memorization skills.
Thus, you can use your textbook and your class notes during in-class exams.
However, you must check with me before consulting any additional references
(and my answer will be negative, usually).
<br>
<b>Of course, no laptops, tablets, phones, pagers, or similar devices
can be used for the duration of an exam.</b>
</p>
<p>
There will be two in-class exams during the course
(after completing lectures on regular languages and on context-free languages, respectively),
each accounting for 15% of your grade,
and a final exam covering the entire course material,
accounting for 30% of your grade.
</p>

<p>
You <b>must</b> do at least somewhat well in these in-class
exams in order to pass the course.
The exercises in these exams are similar to those in the homeworks;
thus, you should be able to gauge how you will do in the in-class exams
by your comfort level in solving the homework exercises.
</p>

<hr size="2"><h3>Final grade policy</h3>
<p>
An overall grade of at least 90% results in a final grade <i>A</i>.
<br>An overall grade of at least 80% but less than 90% results in a final grade
<i>B</i>.
<br>An overall grade of at least 70% but less than 80% results in a final grade
<i>C</i>.
<br>An overall grade of at least 60% but less than 70% results in a final grade
<i>D</i>.
<br>An overall grade of less than 60% results in a final grade
<i>F</i>.
</p><p>I reserve the right to raise the final grade,
but not to lower it: if your overall grade is 89%, I might decide to give
you an <i>A-</i> or a <i>B+</i>, but if it is 80% you are guaranteed at
least a <i>B</i>.
</p>

<hr size="2">
<h3> Detailed schedule</h3>

<p>
This schedule is not written in stone, I expect that deviations
from it will occur over the course of the semester.
The dates of the exams, however, will not change.
