  \begin{quote}
    a) induction on upper bound of summation
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} \[ \forall n \ge 1, \sum_{i=1}^{n}i^3 = (\sum_{i=1}^{n}i)^2 \]\\
      \textit{\textbf{Basis:}} when $n=1, \sum_{i=1}^{n}i^3 = 1, (\sum_{i=1}^{n}i)^2 = 1$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis: }} assume the claim, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^3 =
      (\sum_{i=1}^{n}i)^2$ holds true up to some value $n$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step: }}
      \begin{align*}
        \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}i^3 &= \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}i\right)^2\\
        (n+1)^3 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}i^3 &= (n+1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}i)(n+1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}i)\\
        (n+1)^3 + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}i\right)^2 &= (n+1)^2 + 2(n+1)\sum_{i=1}^{n}i + \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}i\right)^2\\
        (n+1)^3 &= (n+1)^2 + 2(n+1)(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})\\
        (n+1)(n+1)^2 &= (n+1)^2 + n(n+1)^2\\
        n+1 &= 1+n
      \end{align*}
      proving $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i^3 = (\sum_{i=1}^{n}i)^2, \forall n\ge1$ through mathematical induction
    \end{quote}
    b) induction on the term $n$
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} \[\forall n \ge 4, 2^n < n!\]\\
      \textit{\textbf{Basis: }} when $n = 4, 2^n = 16, n! = 24$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis: }} assume the claim $2^n < n!$ holds
      true up to some value $n$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step: }}
      \begin{align*}
        2^{n+1} &< (n+1)!\\
        2 * 2^{n} &< n! * (n+1)\\
        2 * 2^{n} &< n! * (n+1)
      \end{align*}
      since $2^{n}$ is always less than $n!$ by the Inductive Hypothesis the equation only depends on the following
      \begin{align*}
        2 &\le (n+1)\\
        1 &\le n
      \end{align*}
      since $n$ was defined as being greater than equal to 4, $n$ will always be greater than $1$ so this proves the claim
      by induction
    \end{quote}
  \end{quote}

  \question{}
  \begin{quote}
    a)
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} For every Full b-tree $T, n(T) \ge h(T).$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Base Case:}} The b-tree with only one node has $n(T) = 1$ and $h(T) = 1$ so the claim holds.\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}} assume $X, Y$ are two B-Trees such that $n(X) \ge h(X), n(X) \ge n(Y), h(X) \ge h(Y)$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step:}} by the definition of a full b-tree we can create a new full b-tree $Z$
      by adding a new node, and making $X$ the right child of this node and $Y$ the left child of this node.
      this would make $n(Z) = 1 + n(X) + n(Y), h(Z) = 1 + h(X)$, and since $n(x) \ge h(X), n(Y) \ge h(X)$ this would make
      $n(Z) > h(Z)$\\
      this proves the claim by structural induction.
    \end{quote}
    b)
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} For every Full Binary Tree $T, i(T) \ge h(T) - 1$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Base Case:}} consider the B-Tree $T$ with one node $i(T) = 0, h(T) = 1, i(T) = h(T) -1$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}} assume $X, Y$ are two B-Trees such that $i(X) \ge h(X)-1, i(Y) \ge h(Y)-1, h(X) \ge h(Y)$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step:}} a new full b-tree $Z$ can be constructed by adding a new node and make $X$ the right
      child of this node, and $Y$ the left child of this node. $h(Z) = h(X) + 1, i(Z) = i(X) + i(Y) + 1$, since $i(X) \ge h(X)-1$
      $i(X) \ge H(X) -1$\\
      this proves the claim by structural induction
    \end{quote}
    c)
    \begin{quote}
      \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} For every Full Binary Tree $T, \ell(T) = (n(T) + 1)/2$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Base Case:}} consider the B-Tree $T$ with one node $\ell(T) = 1, \frac{n(T)+1}{2} = 1$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}} assume $X, Y$ are two B-Trees such that $\ell(X) = (n(X) + 1)/2, \ell(Y) = (n(Y) + 1)/2$\\
      \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step:}} a b-tree $Z$ can be constructed with one new node that has $X$ as the right child and $Y$ as the
      left child.
      \begin{align*}
        \ell(Z) &= \frac{n(Z)+1}{2}\\
        \ell(X) + \ell(Y) &= \frac{n(X) + n(Y) + 2}{2}\\
        \ell(X) + \ell(Y) &= \frac{n(X) + 1}{2} + \frac{n(Y)+ 1}{2}\\
        \ell(X) + \ell(Y) &= \ell(X) + \ell(Y)
      \end{align*}
      proving the claim by structural induction

  \question{}
  \begin{quote}
    \textit{\textbf{Claim:}} At the start of evey loop the $i^{\text{th}}$ term is
    always the largest from $\{0,\ldots, i\}$\\
    \textit{\textbf{Base Case:}} when $i=0$ there is only one index so it must
    then also be the largest index\\
    \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}} assume in the set $S=\{a[0], \ldots, a[i]\},
    \alpha(S) = a[i]$, where $\alpha$ is a function that returns the max value of a set,
    up to some value $i = n$.\\
    \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step:}} show the claim holds for $i = n + 1$.\\
    by the inductive hypothesis $alpha(\{0,\ldots,a[n]\})= a[n]$. durring the logic
    in the last loop $a[n]$ and $a[n+1]$ where compared and the larger value
    was placed in the $a[n+1]$ index. So $a[n+1] > a[n]$, and $\alpha(\{0,\ldots, a[n+1]\})
    = a[n+1]$ logically follows
  \end{quote}

  \question{}
  \begin{quote}
    \textit{\textbf{Claim 1:}} $a[n-j]\le a[n-j+1]\le a[n-1]$\\
    \textit{\textbf{Claim 2:}} $a[n-j], a[n-j+1],\ldots a[n-1]$ are the
    $j$ largest elements in $a$\\
    \textit{\textbf{Base Case:}} when $j=0, a[n-j]$ is not within the bounds
    of the array, so the set $\{a[n-j], \ldots a[n-1]\} = \theta$, so the
    2 claims follow, since the 0 largest elements are in the set, and each
    element of the set is smaller than the next since there are no elements\\
    \textit{\textbf{Inductive Hypothesis:}} suppose the claims hold up to
    some $j$, that $a[n-j]\le a[n-j+1]\le\ldots a[n-1]$, and $\{a[n-j], a[n-j+1],
    \ldots a[n-1]\}$\\
    \textit{\textbf{Inductive Step:}} it has been proven that the inner loop
    will place the largest value in $\{a[0],\ldots a[i]\}$ at $a[i]$. so
    when the inner loop exits the largest value in $\{a[0],\ldots a[n-j-2]\}$
    at $a[n-j-2]$, if the loop was to continue for another iteration then it would
    start at $a[n-j-1]$, and that would mean that $a[n-j-1]$ must be the largest
    value in the set $a[0],\ldots a[n-j-1]$. proving $\{a[n-(j+1)],\ldots a[n-1]\}$
    would contain the $j+1$ largest elements in $a$ by induction\\
    by the induction hypothesis the set $\{a[n-j],\ldots a[n-1]\}$ contains the $j$
    largest elements in $a$, so $a[n-j-1]\le a[n-j]$ must follow. So
    $a[n-(j+1)]\le a[n-j]\le\ldots a[n-1]$, is true proving claim 1 by induction.

  \question{}
    in the inductive step they argue that since the size of the subset of $S$
    is $m$ that every element in the subset must have the same population by
    the hypothesis. This howevery is not true, because the hypothesis only
    actually supports the claim that $\{c_1,\ldots,c_m\}$ are the same size.
    in other words its not the size of the set that matters its the actual
    first $m$ elements of the set that the hypothesis speaks to.
